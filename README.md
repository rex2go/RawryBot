# RawryBot

RawryBot is my personal twitch bot written in TypeScript which is based on customizable modules.
Furthermore it introduces a chat-based currency called "RawrBucks". 

## Usage
Create a new file called  ``credentials.json`` and fill it with all required credentials based on ``credentials_template.json``.

Then run:
```
npm install && npm start
```

_Tested with node v10.15.1 and npm 6.4.1_
